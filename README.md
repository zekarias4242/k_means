## Introduction

K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used for grouping similar data points into clusters. The project used K-Means to cluster real estate properties based on their characteristics, such as distance to the nearest MRT station, house age, and price.

## Project Overview

- **Data Preparation:** The project begins with data loading and preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and selecting relevant features for clustering.

- **K-Means Clustering:** Applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to group real estate properties into clusters. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow method.

- **Visualization:** Created scatterplots to visualize the clusters, with each cluster assigned a distinct color.

- **Discussion:** provided a discussion of the clustering results, highlighting key insights and patterns in each cluster.

## Dataset
#### Real Estate Valuation Dataset

The Real Estate Valuation dataset used in this project was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real+estate+valuation+data+set). The dataset was originally contributed by Prof. I-Cheng Yeh of the Department of Civil Engineering at National Taiwan University.
The dataset used in this modeling can be found in the file `Realstate_dataset.xlsx`.

## Usage

To replicate this project or apply K-Means clustering to your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset, ensuring it includes suitable features for clustering.
2. Load and preprocess your data using Python and relevant libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).
3. Choose the optimal number of clusters (K) using techniques like the Elbow method.
4. Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to your data.
5. Visualize the clusters using scatterplots or other suitable visualizations.
6. Interpret the results and draw conclusions based on the characteristics of each cluster.

## Results

The results of the K-Means clustering are presented in the project, with each cluster's characteristics discussed. These insights can be valuable for understanding different segments of the real estate market.

## Visualization

The project includes scatterplots that visually represent the clusters. Each cluster is assigned a distinct color for easy identification.

## Discussion

In the discussion section, provided insights into the clusters based on features such as distance to the nearest MRT station, house age, and price. These insights help in understanding the characteristics of each cluster.
